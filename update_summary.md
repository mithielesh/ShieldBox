## Test Cases

Use the `test_email_scan.html` file to test the following scenarios:

### Test Email 1: Phishing Email
- **Expected Result**: Red phishing warning
- **Classification**: Should detect urgency language and requests for personal information

### Test Email 2: Fraud Email
- **Expected Result**: Orange fraud warning
- **Classification**: Should detect financial fraud indicators

### Test Email 3: Spam Email
- **Expected Result**: Yellow spam warning
- **Classification**: Should detect marketing language and promotional content

### Test Email 4: Malware Email
- **Expected Result**: Purple malware warning
- **Classification**: Should detect attachment references and invoice language

### Test Email 5: Legitimate Email
- **Expected Result**: Green safe badge
- **Classification**: Should be identified as legitimate

## Manual Testing

1. **Open the test page**:
   - Open `test_email_scan.html` in your browser
   - Use the test buttons to copy email content

2. **Test in Gmail**:
   - Compose a new email in Gmail
   - Paste the test email content
   - Use ShieldBox to scan the email
   - Verify the correct classification and UI elements appear

3. **Test different notification types**:
   - Verify that appropriate warnings appear for different email types
   - Check that styling is consistent and readable

## Email Classification System

The email scanning functionality has been significantly enhanced to align with the backend model's approach. The system now:

1. **Analyzes Full Email Content**: Scans the subject, sender, and body text (not just URLs)

2. **Uses Category-Specific Term Detection**:
   - **Phishing**: Looks for terms like "verify", "account", "login", "password" 
   - **Fraud**: Detects "money", "bank", "transfer", "inheritance", etc.
   - **Spam**: Identifies promotional language like "offer", "free", "discount"
   - **Malware**: Flags attachment-related terms like "invoice", "download", "zip"

3. **Scores Multiple Categories Simultaneously**: Instead of using simple yes/no rules, the system calculates scores for each category and determines the highest-scoring classification

4. **Detects Sophisticated Patterns**: Looks for:
   - Requests for sensitive information
   - Financial transaction solicitations
   - Shortened URLs
   - Urgent language in subject lines
   - Presence of attachments

5. **Falls Back to Local Analysis**: When the backend is unavailable, it can still accurately classify emails using the same algorithm locally

## Next Steps

1. **Improve ML Integration**:
   - Further refine integration with backend ML model
   - Add feedback mechanism for false positives/negatives

2. **Add customizable security levels**:
   - Allow users to set sensitivity for detection
   - Implement whitelist for trusted senders

3. **Expand email service compatibility**:
   - Test and optimize for Outlook, Yahoo, and ProtonMail
   - Improve email parsing logic for different platforms
